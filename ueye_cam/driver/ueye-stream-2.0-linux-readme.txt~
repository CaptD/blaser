 uEye RTSP Streaming library

(c) 2016, IDS Imaging Development Systems GmbH
 
The uEye Streaming library provides a simple mechanism to set up RTSP server for
streaming images captured with uEye cameras. The uEye Streaming library supports
automatic scaling and encoding of images with video codecs like MJPEG and H.264.
A demo application is also included to set up a RTSP server and to stream images
from a uEye camera.

1 - REQUIREMENTS
----------------
 
SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS
 
 - The IDS Software Suite must be installed. (There is no special version
 dependency to the streamer application)
 - libc version 2.13 and libstdc++ version 6.0.17 have to be installed.
 - To build the example source codes CMake <https://cmake.org> and a C++11
 compatible compiler must be available. For the graphical demo application
 'uEyeStreamer' the Qt development toolkit must be available.
 - To run the binary 'ueye_streamer' under Linux the Qt Runtime (min. v4.5.2)
 is required.
 
 
OTHER REQUIREMENTS
 - If a firewall is active on your system, ensure that ports used for the RTSP
 server are not filtered.
- The H.264 encoder is not distributed with this tar archive. If you want to
 use H.264 streaming the OpenH264 library must be obtained from
 <http://www.openh264.org>. Furthermore, the shared library must be renamed to
 'libopenh264.lib' and must be available in the LD_LIBRARY_PATH path. To use
 H.264 with the demo application copy the library to the <extract dir>/lib/
 directory.
 
 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2 - ARCHIVE FILE STRUCTURE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
The created files will be installed in following structure:
<extract dir>/src/uEyeStreamer/ Streamer demo source files
<extract dir>/src/SimpleStreamer/ Simple streamer application source files
<extract dir>/lib/ uEye streaming shared library files
<extract dir>/lib/ffmpeg/ Pre-built FFmpeg shared library files
<extract dir>/lib/live555/ Pre-built LIVE555 shared library files
<extract dir>/licenses/ License files
<extract dir>/README.txt This readme file
<extract dir>/ueye_streamer.sh Shell script to run the demo application
<extract dir>/bin/ueye_streamer Demo application binary file
<extract dir>/doc/ Library doxygen documentation
<extract dir>/include/ Library include file
 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4 - ARCHIVE EXTRACT INSTRUCTION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
1 - Copy the tar archive into a directory on the hard disk
 (you need write access to decompress).
 
2 - Go to the directory you copied the tar archive into and
 extract the archive files by typing (replace the
 wildcard with the actual version/arch identifier of the
 archive file)
 $> tar -xf ./ueye_stream*.tar.gz

3 - If extract has succeeded, switch to <extract > directory.

4 - You may start the streaming demo application by
 typing '. /ueye_streamer.sh' (Qt runtime must be installed)
 
 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5 - THE DEMONSTRATION PROGRAMS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
The demonstration program shows how to use the uEye streaming library in order
to make following actions:
- RTSP server setup
- Initializing and setup a uEye camera
- Initialize and setup a RTSP stream
- Streaming image data
 
To run the pre-built demo application run the shell script
'<extract dir>/ueye_streamer.sh'. This shell scripts sets the 'LD_LIBRARY_PATH'
to use the pre-built FFmpeg and LIVE555 libraries. The source of the demo
application could be found in '<extract dir>/src/uEyeStreamer/'. Source code for
a simple console demo application is available in
'<extract dir>/src/SimpleStreamer/'.
 
Build applications from source
------------------------------
 
SimpleStreamer
$> 'change dir to build directory'
$> cmake '<extract dir>/src/SimpleStreamer'
$> make
 
uEyeStreamer
$> 'change dir to build directory'
$> cmake '<extract dir>/src/uEyeStreamer'
$> make
 
See CMakelist.txt for further configuration details.
 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
6 - DOCUMENTATION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
A doxygen documentation of the uEye Streaming library is available in HTML
format in the /ueye_stream/doc directory. Also see the example source code
available in the /src directory.
 
Notes
-----
- The RTSP server always binds to every network adapter. A possibility to bind
 only to a specific adapter is not available.
- At the moment, the uEye Streaming library supports    the video codecs MJPEG and
 H.264. Please keep in mind that the maximum resolution for H.264 is 4096 x
 2304 and for MJPEG 2040 x 2040 pixels. Furthermore, the resolution (width,
 height) must be a multiple of 4.
- The submitted image buffers must be in a valid format for the already
 configured stream session (size, pixel format).
- Please consider that the transmission of the stream could be delayed by
 encoding, transmission, media player buffering, et cetera. If images are broken
 or could not be received, try reducing the image resolution, bitrate or
 increase the buffering of the media player software.
- If the streaming library is closed it is possible that the used port is not
 freed immediately. A reinitialization could therefore be denied until the port
 is freed by the OS.
 
What's new?
-----------
Version 2.0
Date: 2016/06/08
 
The uEye Streaming library has been reworked. Methods, enumerations, and
structures have been renamed to get the relationships more clearly. The live
media library has been updated to version 2016/04/21. The FFmpeg libraries has
been updated to version 2.8.7. The OpenH264 encoder is now used for H.264
encoding.
